            <p>Your day on the Rio Grande combines excellent birding and wildlife viewing with ancient petroglyphs and desert freshwater springs, as well as Class III rapids.
                This combination makes a fantastic adventure for families, first-time rafters, and groups of all ages. </p>

            </div>
            <p>The day begins at our headquarters, where you'll meet your guides for the day and you will be outfitted with gear. After you put your sunblock on, we will make the short drive to the starting point and your trip begins with a quiet morning float through the scenic canyon. You may see wildlife such as river otter, beavers, and many different birds.</p>

            </div>
            <p>You will practice paddling techniques along these gentle waters, and we will stop for lunch. After lunch, we will run the Class III rapids of the "Racecourse". The Racecourse is 6 miles of action-packed Class II-III rapids, safe enough for the whole family yet exciting enough for adrenaline junkies.</p>

            </div>
            <p>You will be safely navigated through rapids such as the Maze, Albert's Falls, The Narrows, and The Thunderdome by our excellent - world class - guides. They are extremely knowledgable about the area's geology, ecology, and history, and will teach you as much as you'd like to learn about the area as you float past.</p>

            <p>Full Day Rio Grande Racecourse trips are available Wednesdays through Saturdays, starting in April through October. Please see our Trips page for more information about other rafting trips we offer. We want you to have the best possible day on the rivers of the southwest!</p>
