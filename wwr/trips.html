                    <p>The <b>Rio Grande Racecourse full-day trip </b>begins at 8:30am at our headquarters, where you
                        will meet your guides for the day. After a short van ride, your river trip begins with a calm
                        and scenic ride through the canyon with opportunities to view birds and wildlife and practice
                        paddling. After a picnic lunch by the side of the river, you will enjoy the Class
                        II-III rapids of the Racecourse. Lunch and snacks are provided.</p>

                    <p>The <b>Rio Chama 3 day trip </b>consists of a relaxed 3-day itinerary where we stop and explore
                        hot springs, ancient ruins, and dinosaur tracks. We camp for two nights under the bright New
                        Mexican sky on the sandy river beaches. There will be time for hiking and exploring in this
                        beautiful area. We will float past the colorful sandstone and limestone walls of the
                        canyon and finish up near the artist village of Abiquiu. All camping gear and meals
                        will be provided.</p>

                    <p>The <b>Rio Grande Float half-day trip</b> begins at 9:00am at our headquarter office. After a
                        short van ride, you will enjoy a relaxing float through a scenic canyon with great opportunities
                        to see wildlife and many different types of water birds and birds of prey. This is
                        the perfect trip for anyone who needs some relaxing time to just float amongst the beautiful
                        canyon scenery. The float takes about 3 hours. Snacks are provided.</p>

                    <p>The <b>Taos Box full-day trip</b> begins at 8:30am and is usually finished by 3:00pm, depending
                        on the water levels. This river run through the heart of the Rio Grande Gorge begins relatively
                        calmly with plenty of opportunities to work on your paddling techniques. About half-way through,
                        a delicious riverside lunch will be served. After lunch, you will enjoy the Class IV
                        whitewater rapids throughout the last five miles of the trip. You will paddle with a team with a
                        guide sitting in back to steer you safely through the rapids.</p>

                    <p>For confident kayakers, the <b>Taos Box kayak trip</b> offers the opportunity to paddle your own
                        boat on the middle Taos Box section. You will pack an inflatable kayak to the confluence of the
                        Red River and the Rio Grande and will get all the instruction you need from your guides. The
                        whitewater on this section is calm with one class III rapid. We will serve you lunch
                        on the beach and, after a short hike, you can see some riverside archeology sites. </p>
