            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Rio Grande White Water Rafting Company was founded in 2026 by expert river guides Pam and Matt
                Christison. We
                have been exploring the wild rivers of the Southwest for the last 20 years, and we know them inside and
                out. We love to share the beauty of our waterways and would consider it an honor to work with your group
                on your own adventure. Our trips include natural and cultural history of the region, combined with the
                thrills
                of rafting adventure. Our guiding staff are exceptional and will personalize your trip to make sure
                your group's experience exceeds your expectations. </p>
