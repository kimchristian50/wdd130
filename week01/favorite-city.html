    <h1>My Favorite City</h1>
    <p>My favorite city is Stockholm. It is the capital of Sweden and is set on a beautiful
        archipelago where Lake Mälaren meets the Baltic Sea. This is the view you see when you
        approach it via ferry.</p>

    <p>The historic Gamla Stan area is the oldest part of the city, with a palace to tour, shopping,
        and restaurants.</p>

    <p>The chapel within the palace is extremely ornate.</p>

    <p>The Vasa Museum holds a restored ship which sank in Sweden's cold waters in 1628, where it
        was preserved and later restored.</p>
