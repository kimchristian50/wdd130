        <p>I'm a mom, a chemical engineer, a patent analyst, and I'm studying Computer Science. My
            family and I love to travel, create, and love being members of the Church of Jesus
            Christ of Latter-day Saints. Right now I am a seminary teacher, and I love getting to spend time with my
            co-teacher husband and the students every morning at 6:10am. I'm also the ward organist and have the
            powerful ability to choose the music every Sunday. My family and I most recently traveled to Scandinavia,
            which was an amazing trip where we saw castles, cathedrals, art, former military installations, fjords, and
            lots of waterfalls. New Mexico is low on waterfalls, in particular near the Albuquerque area where we live,
            so we especially enjoyed all the water. One highlight for our family was that we were able to visit the
            Copenhagen temple.
            Other favorite places were the Viking museum in Roskilde, the Viking village Njardarheimr in Gudvangen, and
            the Vasa warship restoration museum in Stockholm. We were also able to take the overnight ferry/cruise
            between Helsinki and Stockholm and see the beautiful archipelago as we neared Sweden. This picture was taken
            in Hovdestøylen, a ski resort area in Norway.</p>

        <p>New Mexico is a southwestern U.S. state known for its striking desert and mountain landscapes, rich Native
            American and Hispanic heritage, and long, layered history. It is home to diverse geography ranging from high
            desert mesas and red rock formations to forested mountains. The state also plays an important role in science
            and national defense, with major research institutions and national laboratories, while maintaining a strong
            connection to tradition, land, and community.</p>
