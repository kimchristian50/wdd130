        <p>"New Mexico is a southwestern U.S. state known for its striking desert and mountain landscapes, rich Native
            American and Hispanic heritage, and long, layered history. It is home to diverse geography ranging from high
            desert mesas and red rock formations to forested mountains, which contributes to a wide range of climates
            and outdoor activities. New Mexico culture reflects a blend of Indigenous, Spanish, Mexican, and Anglo
            influences, visible in its art, architecture, and cuisine. The state also plays an important role in science
            and national defense, with major research institutions and national laboratories, while maintaining a strong
            connection to tradition, land, and community." - wiki</p>
