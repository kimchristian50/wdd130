        <p>I'm a mom, a chemical engineer, a patent analyst, and I'm studying Computer Science. My
            family and I love to travel, create, and love being members of the Church of Jesus
            Christ of Latter-day Saints. Right now I am a seminary teacher, and I love getting to spend time with my
            co-teacher husband and the students every morning at 6:10am. I'm also the ward organist and have the
            powerful ability to choose the music every Sunday.  </p>

        <p>New Mexico is a southwestern U.S. state known for its striking desert and mountain landscapes, rich Native
            American and Hispanic heritage, and long, layered history. It is home to diverse geography ranging from high
            desert mesas and red rock formations to forested mountains. The state also plays an important role in science
            and national defense, with major research institutions and national laboratories, while maintaining a strong
            connection to tradition, land, and community.</p>
